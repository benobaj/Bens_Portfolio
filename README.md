# [Project 1: TankJuice Storemanagement](https://github.com/RonitMalik/Movie-Recommendation-System-)

The administration of the Tankjuice Store oversees and manages all business activities. Working with staff, making work plans, corresponding with suppliers, and handling consumer complaints are some of its primary tasks. Simple job delegation and priority setting for your team's top priorities. Organise your team's task, set project deadlines and milestones, and monitor progress all in one location. To construct an autonomous workflow system using holistics as a data warehouse and retain a LIVE dashboard and updates on their daily operations, they used Tableau, Excel, and Google.

* Data was taken from POS systems into the data warehouse 
* The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques. 
* Coding Used : VBA, SQL and Google appscript and javascript

# [Project 2: MAXIMO Manufacturing and Operation Data architecture](https://github.com/RonitMalik/BlackFriday_pythonScrapper)

Maximo Manufacturing dashboards save the time it takes to respond to operational issues, and by giving management a better understanding of minute-by-minute operations, they provide crucial information so they can plan a reaction. Common KPIs include: Delivery performance
Manufacturing lead time, often known as "total cycle time," is the amount of time it takes for an order to go through the production.
OEE is valuable since it compiles information on output rates, product quality, and machine availability. The business intelligence system powers these dashboards. In order to give KPIs like order intake, warranty costs, delivery schedule achievement, and (of course) cash flow, this collects data from ERP, MES, and other systems.
