# [Project Energy Consumption ](Energyconsumption/HourlyEnergyConsumptionpage.md)
Description:
The Python code is designed to analyze and visualize global energy consumption data. It aims to provide insights into the trends and patterns of energy consumption across different regions and energy sources. The code utilizes various libraries and techniques to process and visualize the data effectively.

Key Features:

Data Retrieval and Preparation: The code begins by retrieving energy consumption data from a reliable sources, international energy agencies and databases. The data is then cleaned and organized for further analysis.

Data Analysis:

Region-wise Analysis: The code categorizes countries into regions (e.g., continents) and calculates the total energy consumption for each region over a specific time period.
Energy Source Analysis: It analyzes the energy consumption distribution across different sources like fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas), renewable sources (solar, wind, hydro), and nuclear energy.
Trends and Patterns: The code identifies trends and patterns in energy consumption, such as growth rates, changes in consumption over time, and shifts in energy source preferences.

# [Project 1: Maximo LookerStudio](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/e1fbfc58-a0dc-48d3-8b5f-8cf12e61aa23)

This dashboard provides a real-time visual picture of the manufacturing process in Maximo. Manufacturing dashboards display information and insights on each department's financial situation throughout the course of the year. Obtaining production-related metrics data from the previous shift or day, such as sales and performance relative to goals, are examples of the type of data. The data is now 12 to 24 hours old.  After that, I compile this data into status reports for the directors. The focus is typically on direct expenses and performance relative to the plan.

# [Project 2: TankJuice Storemanagement](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1nEaTTt8odZ6MsGqOxkRwnXm_1DUOrBp_SKFCkDBndjw/edit?usp=sharing)

The administration of the Tankjuice Store oversees and manages all business activities. Working with staff, making work plans, corresponding with suppliers, and handling consumer complaints are some of its primary tasks. Simple job delegation and priority setting for your team's top priorities. Organise your team's task, set project deadlines and milestones, and monitor progress all in one location. To construct an autonomous workflow system using holistics as a data warehouse and retain a LIVE dashboard and updates on their daily operations, they used Tableau, Excel, and Google.

* Data was taken from POS systems into the data warehouse 
* The model uses both; content-based filtering techniques and collaborative filtering techniques. 
* Coding Used : VBA, SQL and Google appscript and javascript

# [Project 3: MAXIMO Manufacturing and Operation Data architecture](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iTGZgBQPVSjoE60fn6V6jQt_tMf1DCQ3/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=115884990578000692853&rtpof=true&sd=true)

Maximo Manufacturing dashboards save the time it takes to respond to operational issues, and by giving management a better understanding of minute-by-minute operations, they provide crucial information so they can plan a reaction. Common KPIs include: Delivery performance
Manufacturing lead time, often known as "total cycle time," is the amount of time it takes for an order to go through the production.
OEE is valuable since it compiles information on output rates, product quality, and machine availability. The business intelligence system powers these dashboards. In order to give KPIs like order intake, warranty costs, delivery schedule achievement, and (of course) cash flow, this collects data from ERP, MES, and other systems.
